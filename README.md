# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using Python. The notebook (`KNN.ipynb`) contains an exploration of the KNN model, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Implements KNN for classification of Hadron and Gamma particles
- Uses a dataset for model training and testing
- Includes performance evaluation metrics

## Requirements
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (install with `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`)

## Usage
 Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
